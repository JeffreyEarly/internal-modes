# Version History

## Unreleased

- Add `assessModeConvergence` for per-mode comparisons of explicitly prepared eigenproblem refinements, with scientific-label matching, common sign alignment, relative equivalent-depth/shape/derivative and joint H¹ measurements, and caller-owned tolerances. No additional solves or automatic mode selection occur during assessment.
- Allow exact bulk wave construction to request different positive mode counts at each horizontal wavenumber while preserving scalar shorthand, repeated-wavenumber consistency and independent inertial counts. Add a reproducible example plotting mode-convergence and physical-grid limits versus wavenumber.

## [2.0.0-beta.3] - 2026-09-08

- Scale Chebyshev coefficient unknowns in the V2 spectral eigensolve to reduce derivative-amplified roundoff in long external waves. Recover the original native coefficients before finite-mode filtering and normalization; retain the physical EVP, boundary conditions, requested modes and finite-difference behavior. Add direct and sampled vertical-momentum regressions across coordinate choices and spectral resolutions.

## [2.0.0-beta.2] - 2026-09-08

- Added `IMBasisCollection` and `IMProjection` with hidden basis-owned pairing descriptors, structured assessment results, and separate explicit checking functions. Scientific labels, unequal page counts, supplied samples/weights, signed physical duals, positive error norms, and unsupported capabilities remain explicit.
- Added exact bulk wave construction with shared preparation, ordered/repeated wavenumber mapping, independent zero-wavenumber inertial counts, and bounded continuous evaluation. The shared scalar/bulk solve preserves equation equilibration and consistent finite-mode filtering.
- Added `IMProductAssessmentPlan`, factor/output structures, budget reservation before evaluation, independent-reference diagnostics, coverage comparison, and advisory decisions that preserve scientific counts and endpoints.
- Preserved direct-projection and prefix provenance. The three new public classes replace the unreleased recipe, inventory, and assessment-result classes; released transform APIs remain available.

## V2 development through 2.0.0-beta.1
- stabilized the analytical negative-APV characteristic determinant for strongly localized endpoint modes by cancelling known Bessel exponential factors before root finding; added independent spectral and endpoint-residual checks
- equilibrated generalized eigenproblem rows before solving, reducing high-resolution APV mode and endpoint-response errors while preserving the physical matrices for mode classification and diagnostics
- made spectral stretched-coordinate maps, inverse maps, Jacobians, and second derivatives use one smooth Chebfun representation, removing the inconsistent trapezoidal/PCHIP and endpoint-gradient error floor in WKB and density coordinates
- corrected solved G-mode normalization and projection to use the canonical EVP interior weight, including `(N2-f0^2)/g` for fixed-wavenumber waves and `(N2-omega^2)/g` for fixed-frequency waves; positive majorants now also take the absolute interior weight
- removed the obsolete legacy fixed-frequency normalization path from production solvers, analytical helpers, examples, tests, and user documentation
- added the induced Hilbert-majorant APIs `majorantInnerProduct`, `majorantGramMatrix`, `majorantNorm`, and `targetMajorantGramMatrix`; retained signed Pontryagin projection and spectra; and enabled coupled APV quadratic certification with retained negative modes by measuring relative errors in the positive majorant
- moved singular-pencil rejection into generic eigenpair processing and made zero-norm classification mode-local, preventing near-null generalized eigenvectors and unrelated large columns from corrupting physical mode selection
- identified the integrated V2 development package as `2.0.0-beta.1`; this remains a prerelease and does not declare or publish a stable V2 API
- reconciled the scalar and aligned transform contracts, centralized retained-band fitting and normalization policy, simplified redundant validation, and qualified the V2 API, examples, generated reference, and installed package as one integration increment
- replaced the V2 analytical SQG-profile and availability-report APIs with concrete constant- and exponential-stratification `geostrophicZeroAPVModesAtWavenumber` constructors, exact canonical `F/G` endpoint responses, and an `IMAnalyticalGeostrophicZeroAPVModesBasis` supporting the numerical quadratic-form and rotation contracts
- replaced the projected surface-geostrophic API with coefficient-independent `IMGeostrophicZeroAPVModes` boundary-response problems, page-shaped canonical `F/G` bases, explicit physical-energy and endpoint-buoyancy forms, and boundary-depth, surface-buoyancy, and custom symmetric-pencil rotations
- added the public v2 `IMInternalModes.geostrophicAPVModes` generalized-energy APV factory, signed endpoint-limit mappings and metadata, exact numerical zero retention, volume-only `depth` normalization, and exact constant-stratification trigonometric/affine/hyperbolic branches with independent factory, endpoint, normalization, analytical-root, and refined-spectral regression coverage
- added exact exponential-stratification generalized-energy geostrophic APV modes, including positive, zero, and negative equivalent-depth branches, free-surface and rigid-lid conventions, all finite/zero/infinite endpoint limits, signed-spectrum diagnostics, and analytical-versus-numerical regression coverage
- added v2 scalar discrete Galerkin transforms on caller-supplied points and quadrature weights, including forward and inverse matrices, forward and back transform methods, sampled metrics, continuous Gram targets, and transform-quality diagnostics
- added fixed-point v2 quadrature fitting with normalized Gram objectives, nonnegative full-depth constraints, custom least-squares systems, and fitted-versus-geometric diagnostics
- made fixed-point fitting depth-scale robust and added v2 walkthroughs for default and custom scalar discrete-transform workflows
- added v2 `pointsFromModeRoots` grids with automatic auxiliary-mode solves and native Chebyshev root finding for all spectral coordinate choices
- compressed the normalized Gram Frobenius fit to independent symmetric mode pairs
- added exact point-limited scalar transform construction and `IMDiscreteTransformAssessment`, including one-rule retained-prefix Gram diagnostics, optional rejected-mode leakage and scalar quadratic-aliasing policies, strict explicit-band failures, and constant/exponential/DCT-I regression coverage
- added aligned internal-mode `F/G` discrete transforms with one shared point-and-weight rule, variable-qualified synthesis and projection matrices, zero-column active projectors, endpoint and physical metadata snapshots, stacked shared-weight fitting, worst-channel Gram and leakage policies, and coupled `FF->F`, `FG->G`, and `GG->F` quadratic-aliasing assessment
- added `IMGeostrophicTransform` to compose generalized-energy APV transforms with boundary-normalized or rotated geostrophic zero-APV coordinates, including admissible-state inversion, generic volume-plus-endpoint source projection, explicit wavenumber pages, singularity diagnostics, and arbitrary trailing field dimensions
- added generalized-energy mean-density-anomaly `G` modes with finite/zero/inactive endpoint limits, signed-unit normalization and signatures, exact constant-null handling, surface-referenced spectral `F` integration, aligned sampled transforms with direct `G` projection and diagnostic `F` synthesis, and rejection of numerically finite representations of infinite generalized eigenmodes
