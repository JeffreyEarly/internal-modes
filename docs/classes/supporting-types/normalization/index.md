## Overview

`Normalization` collects the normalization choices used throughout
the `internal-modes` hierarchy. Following Section 2.4 of Early,
Lelong, and Smith (2020), the main wave-mode norms are the
`kConstant` norm based on the fixed-$$K$$ orthogonality relation and
the `omegaConstant` norm based on the fixed-$$\omega$$ relation.

The valid values are:

- `Normalization.kConstant` for the manuscript's $$K$$-constant norm
- `Normalization.omegaConstant` for the manuscript's
  $$\omega$$-constant norm
- `Normalization.uMax` to scale each mode so $$\max F_j = 1$$
- `Normalization.wMax` to scale each mode so $$\max G_j = 1$$
- `Normalization.surfacePressure` to scale by the surface value of
  $$F$$
- `Normalization.geostrophic` for the near-geostrophic interior mode
  normalization used by some helper workflows

```matlab
im = InternalModes(rho, zIn, zOut, latitude);
im.normalization = Normalization.kConstant;
```
